3. To Run
=========

On dev (http://home.bebif.be/ifbl) 

=> $ unicorn_rails -D -p 3008 --path /ifbl

On production machine (http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl)

=> $ sudo -H -u www-ifbl bash --login (to have a correct shell environment that plays nicely with RVM)
=> rvm 1.9.2@ifbl (to load correct ruby&gems version)
=> unicorn_rails -E production -p 5021 --path /ifbl

4. to install
=============

- configure database.yml correctly
- also configure Geoserver to serve the data: see in new_data_import/README.txt
- bundle install to install dependencies
- in application.js, configure:

IFBL.constants.wms_url 

In production, we set it to: "http://projects.biodiversity.be/geoserver2/ifbl/wms". This is not the real server (it's at gis.biodiversity.be), but this is a proxy Julien 
had to setup to avoir same-origin-policy issues.
