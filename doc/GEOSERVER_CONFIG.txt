IFBL: Configure Geoserver
=========================

Note for data layers originating from PostGIS:

If you have different postgres schemas - for example to isolate PostGIS - 
we have to create a specific user and execute something like "alter user myuser set search_path to gis,public", 
because Geoserver is not able to let us configure access to multiple schemas simultaneously. 

1. Layouts
==========

These layouts are used to add fixed images to printable maps (BBPF logo, legend for ecoregions, ...).

Layouts are configured manually (command-line in geoserver). In geoserver data dir, we should also a "layouts" directory containing two files:

ifbl\_print\_w\_ecoregions.xml:

    <layout>
        <decoration type="image" affinity="bottom,left" offset="36,36">
            <option name="url" value="http://home.bebif.be/ifbl/images/bbpf_logo.png"/>
        </decoration>
        <decoration type="image" affinity="bottom,left" offset="36,200">
            <option name="url" value="http://home.bebif.be/ifbl/images/ecoregion_legend.png"/>
        </decoration>
    </layout>

ifbl\_print.xml:

Idem, but without the second (ecoregion) "decoration" block.

Of course, path to the image files should be adapted to the current configuration.

2. Styles (SLD)
===============

A few styles are needed for the webapp and the printable maps feature. These styles can be found in the sld directory.

Please keep their correct name (they are sometimes explicitly required in WMS requests).

* **ecoregions.xml** for bbpf:ecoregions (static colors for Ecoregions of Belgium)
* **ifbl_noparam.xml** is used on the two layers in use on the browse page of the website (green square with opaque black border).
* **ifbl_param.xml** is used on the search page (two layers) to display data: the squares have no border, are transparent (opacity=0.4) and their color is configurable.
* **ifbl_param_print.xml** is similar to ifbl_param BUT opacity is set to 1. This is used for printable maps, because as we have a very light backgound, we want to cover it more.
* **ifbl_print_background.xml** is used to style the country borders layer in printable maps. It is very minimal.    

3. Workspaces
=============

We create an ifbl workspace for specific data, and use a bbpf workspace for more generic data (ecoregions of Belgium, country boundaries, ...)

4. Layers
=========

ifbl:areas\_4\_derived\_from\_1
-------------------------------

Use: Used on the browse page to show the large (generalized) squares.   
SRS: EPSG:3857 (google Mercator)  
Default Style: ifbl\_noparam  
Other available styles: /  
Data source: areas\_4\_derived\_from\_1 table (from the IFBL database)  

ifbl:areas\_with\_direct\_cheklists
-----------------------------------

Use: Use on the browse page to show the detailed, non-generalized squares  
SRS: EPSG:3857  
Default Style: ifbl\_noparam   
Other available styles:   
Data source: areas\_with\_direct\_checklists (from the IFBL database)  

ifbl:squares\_per\_species\_and\_time
-------------------------------------

Use: Queryable layer to display where a species occurs, optionaly with date and/or square filters (non-generalized layer). Used on search page and on printable maps.  
SRS: EPSG: 3857  
Default Style: ifbl\_param  
Other available styles: ifbl\_param\_print  
Data source: 

We have to create an SQL view in Geoserver to handle this:

    SELECT areas.the_geom, areas.ifbl_code, count(*) AS nb_observations, observations.species_id
    FROM nbgb_ifbl.areas, nbgb_ifbl.checklists, nbgb_ifbl.observations
    WHERE checklists.area3_id = areas.id AND observations.checklist_id = checklists.id
    AND ((checklists.begin_date, checklists.end_date) OVERLAPS (DATE '%range_start%', DATE '%range_end%'))
    GROUP BY areas.ifbl_code, areas.the_geom, observations.species_id

Sql parameters:

    range_start + 1000-01-01 + ^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d$
    range_end + 70000-12-31 + ^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d$

Attributes:

    the_geom + geometry + 3857
    
ifbl:squares4\_per\_species\_and\_time
--------------------------------------

Use: Queryable layer to display where a species occurs, optionaly with date and/or square filters (generalized layer). Used on search page and on printable maps.
Configuration: perfect clone of ifbl:squares\_per\_species\_and\_time, except:

    WHERE checklists.area2_id =
    
bbpf:TM\_WORLD\_BORDERS-0
-------------------------

Use: On printable maps, country borders  
SRS: EPSG:3857 (reproject native to declared)  
Default style: ifbl_print_background  
Other available styles: /  
Data source: shapefile (should be in our shapefile bank)

bbpf:ecoregions
---------------

Use: Ecoregions overlay (on search, browse and printable map)  
SRS: EPSG:3857 (reproject native to declared)  
Default style: ecoregions  
Other available styles: /  
Data source: shapefile (should be in our shapefile bank)
