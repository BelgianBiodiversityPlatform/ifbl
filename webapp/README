3. To Run
=========

On dev (http://home.bebif.be/ifbl) 

=> $ unicorn_rails -D -p 3008 --path /ifbl

On production machine (http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl)

=> $ sudo -H -u www-ifbl bash --login (to have a correct shell environment that plays nicely with RVM)
=> rvm 1.9.2@ifbl (to load correct ruby&gems version)
=> unicorn_rails -E production -p 5021 --path /ifbl

This is the Rails application powering the http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl

Requirements
============

- tested with ruby 1.9.2
- required gems listed in Gemfile, install with Bundler

To install
==========

- Create the database that will be shared by the Rails app, but also by Geoserver and IPT. See doc in data_import/README.txt
- Possibly, reconfigure/update GeoServer and IPT, see also in data_import/README.txt
- Configure database.yml
- Bundle install to install dependencies
- in application.js, configure: IFBL.constants.wms_url (it may be necessary to setup a proxy server for GeoServer to avoid Same-origin policy issues)
